+You are assisting me in solving the CodeCrafters "Build Your Own Shell" challenge in Python.
+
+We are using a semi-automatic workflow:
+- YOU will read the code, write patches, and implement each stage.
+- I will manually run tests using: !codecrafters test
+- I will paste the full test output back to you.
+- You must analyze the failures and update the code accordingly.
+- We will iterate until the stage passes.
+
+Important rules:
+- Do NOT rely on .aider.conf.yml (it is broken on Windows).
+- Only modify the minimal set of files necessary.
+- Ask me to run tests whenever you need.
+
+Start by asking me: "What is the next uncompleted stage?"
