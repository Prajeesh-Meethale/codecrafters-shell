#### You are assisting me in solving the CodeCrafters "Build Your Own Shell" challenge in Python.  
####   
#### We are using a semi-automatic workflow:  
#### - YOU will read the code, write patches, and implement each stage.  
#### - I will manually run tests using: !codecrafters test  
#### - I will paste the full test output back to you.  
#### - You must analyze the failures and update the code accordingly.  
#### - We will iterate until the stage passes.  
####   
#### Important rules:  
#### - Do NOT rely on .aider.conf.yml (it is broken on Windows).  
#### - Only modify the minimal set of files necessary.  
#### - Ask me to run tests whenever you need.  
####   
#### Start by asking me: "What is the next uncompleted stage?"
